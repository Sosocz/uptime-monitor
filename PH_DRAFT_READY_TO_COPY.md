## 💬 FIRST COMMENT (Hunter's Introduction)

Copier-coller ce texte exactement :

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm launching **TrezApp** - a dead-simple uptime monitoring tool I built because I was tired of:
- Complex dashboards nobody uses
- Alert spam (5 emails for 1 incident)
- Expensive pricing ($79+/month for basic features)

**What TrezApp does differently:**

✅ **30-second setup** - Add URL, done. No config hell.
✅ **Telegram alerts** - Instant mobile notifications (not just email)
✅ **Public status pages** - Show your uptime to clients (FREE plan!)
✅ **Smart alerting** - No spam. One alert per incident with cooldowns.
✅ **Free forever** - 10 monitors, 5-min checks, unlimited alerts

**Perfect for:**
- SaaS founders monitoring their apps
- Freelancers/agencies managing client sites
- Anyone who needs "set and forget" monitoring

**🎁 Product Hunt Special:**
Get PRO (€19/month) at **€13/month FOREVER** with code `PRODUCTHUNT30`
→ That's 30% off for life, not a trial.

Try it: https://trezapp.com

Questions? Fire away! I'll be here all day. 🔥

## 🤝 RÉPONSES PRÉ-ÉCRITES (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Q: "How is this different from UptimeRobot?"

```
Great question!

UptimeRobot is solid, but TrezApp has:
✅ Telegram alerts built-in (not just webhooks)
✅ Status pages FREE (paid on UptimeRobot)
✅ Modern UX (UptimeRobot UI is from 2012)
✅ No alert spam (smart cooldowns)

UptimeRobot has 50 monitors free vs our 10, but we focus on quality over quantity. If you need 50+ monitors on free, stick with UptimeRobot. If you want a cleaner, more modern tool with Telegram → try TrezApp.
```

### Q: "Why not Pingdom/Better Uptime?"

```
They're excellent enterprise tools with enterprise pricing ($79-299/month).

TrezApp is for:
- Solo founders who don't need on-call rotation
- Small teams who want "set and forget"
- Anyone who thinks $79/month is overkill

We're 80% of the features at 1/5 of the price. If you're a 50+ person company, go with Better Uptime. If you're an indie maker or small team, TrezApp is perfect.
```

---

### Q: "What about privacy?"

```
- We don't store personal data beyond email
- Checks run from EU servers (Paris)
- No tracking cookies on status pages
- GDPR compliant
- Open to host in other regions based on demand

Your data is yours. We just ping your site and alert you if it's down.
```

---

### Q: "Roadmap?"

```
Top priorities based on feedback:
1. Multi-region checks (US, EU, Asia)
2. Custom domains for status pages (coming soon)
3. Slack/Discord native integrations
4. 1-minute checks on FREE plan (maybe)

But honestly: we ship what users ask for. Tell me what you need and I'll prioritize it!
```

---

### Q: "How do you make money?"

```
Pro plan (€19/month):
- Unlimited monitors
- 1-minute checks
- Webhooks & API
- Custom domains
- Remove "Powered by" badge

Our goal: stay affordable for indie makers while building a sustainable business. We're not VC-backed, so we price fairly and listen to users.
```

---

### Q: "Is the code open source?"

```
Not yet, but we're considering it.

The monitoring logic is pretty straightforward (HTTP checks + alerts), but we've spent time on the UX and reliability. If there's strong interest from the community, we might open-source parts of it.

What would you like to see open-sourced?
```

---

### Q: "Any integrations planned?"

```
Yes! Currently we have:
✅ Email
✅ Telegram
✅ Webhooks (for custom integrations)

Coming soon:
- Slack (native)
- Discord (native)
- PagerDuty
- Zapier/Make
- API for custom integrations

Which integration would you use first?
